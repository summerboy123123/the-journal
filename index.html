        <h3>DAY 1</h3>
        <p>
            I seem to have clipped in this hallway when I went down an alley. I don't really know where I am right now, but
            all I can see is long hallways and stains on the wall. I'm scared.
        </p>

        <h3>DAY 2</h3>
        <p>
            I slept on the floor of this place, it wasn't that nice. the floor was very wet and slimy. I started searching
            for what might have made the slime. A little while later I was able to find a small slime blob, it was orange
            and had a small cute face. Once it had seen me it jolted at me. I think it was trying to tickle me, so I jumped
            back and ran for my life. Thank goodness it was about as fast as a slug, so I could easily run away.
        </p>

        <h3>DAY 3</h3>
        <p>
         I found a small bench with a wet pillow on it, so I slept there for the night. It wasn't the best but at least I 
            was off the floor. Once I woke up I heard rumbling noises coming from a room next to where I slept. I peeped
            inside it and I saw a huge black figrue. Its back was turned against me so it didn't see me. When I saw the
            monster I grabbed the pillow I had slept on and sprinted away. The monster looked like it was dripping
            with oil or black sludge. I tried to find a way out of this creepy place but it seemed like it kept on going
            forever

        <div>
        <h3>DAY 4</h3>
        <p>
           I feel super hungry, but thankfully I have been finding almond water everywhere. At first it seemed a little weird, but now Im getting used to it. I have also been seeing these other monsters lurching around, I even saw another human being tangled by a red and white beast. The beast said something like, "Why you in backrooms human?" At that point I had never ever heard of backrooms, but I guess that's where I am right now.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h3>DAY 7</h3>
        <p>
            I have been forgetting to write in the journle. I've been seeing lots of monsters go by and collecting almond water, but today I found a black void in the middle of the floor. I have been seeing lots and lots of deep holes in the floor, but nothing like what I saw here. It was swirling round and round, and I saw one of the monsters come after me so I leapt into the black void.

        </p>

        <h3>DAY 8</h3>
        <p>
           It seemed I teleported to another room. This one had office chairs and desks in it. Their were endless doors I could open one and there would be 3 more. When I opened a door, I made sure I had closed it so that nothing could follow me.

        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>DAY 9</h3>
        <p>
           This place is making me crazy. I thought I saw my brother here but I was just day dreaming. I seem to have run into a iron door with a big metal lock on it. I dont know were that had come from but I wanted to know more, then I saw the orange monster again but this time it was faster than beafore. I ran as fast as I could to get away from it but it was way to fast, so when it was chasing me I hid behind a corner and hoped it wouldnt see me.

        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>DAY 10</h3>
        <p>
           I am very happy that the orange monster did not see me. I have stumbed upon an old computer, I tried to turn it on but it was no use. I checked to see if the plug was in but their was no plug.

        </p>

    <div>
        <h3>DAY 11</h3>
        <p>
           the days seem to go faster now, but I found some nuts in a zip lock back behind a family photo on a shelf. I was quite creep out of the family photo it had a father, mother and 2 kids but the creepy part is that the father was crossed out. I didnt really know what that meant but all I wanted were the nuts.

        </p>
    </div>

       <div>
        <h3>DAY 12</h3>
        <p>
           Im really happy those nuts were not poisioned otherwise I would have died. This time I slept on a propper bed which I am very happy about and I still have my pillow which its almost dry by now.

        </p>
    </div>

       <div>
        <h3>DAY 13</h3>
        <p>
           I saw another black figure today but this time it was smaller than before. I wondered why their were monsters in this place and why I was here but before I could think anymore one of the monsters came after me. I didnt know what to do, because the door behind me wouldn't open. It was getting very close to me and then it grabbed me by the neck and said "Why you here!"


        </p>
    </div>
          
       <div>
        <h3>DAY 14</h3>
        <p>
           I woke up in a small room with another human in a rope like I was. I ask them their name but they were not responding to me. I also thought that the person looked very familiar, and thats when it hit me. That was the person being tangled by the red and white beast. I ask again "Hello." but still no answer. I needed to know why that person was not talking and why I was tied up. I had so many questions but no answers.

        </p>
    </div>

       <div>
        <h3>DAY 15</h3>
        <p>
           Im still in this dark small room with this other human not talking to me. I saw one of the monsters throw another human in here so I guess their are more humans running around this madhouse. I tried to say "Hi," but before I could say anything the human not talking to me started talking alot. The person said "Hi," to me in a jolly voice, so I said "Hi," back to the person. I ask them their name and he said "My name is Tom." I was just happy to meet someone new for once. Tom told me about how we are trapped here and their are entities looking for us. I was super surprissed that the monsters were looking for us. I really wanted to ask more questions but we were all tired.


        </p>
    </div>

       <div>
        <h3>DAY 16</h3>
        <p>
           me and Tom tried to get out of the rope with our teeth but it was no use we were trapped here, but luckily Tom remembered he had a pocket knife, so he cut his rope and then untied me. We were not sure what to do with that other guy so we just left im there. We didnt really know what we were doing so we just went though a few doors and I made sure I had closed them. After awhile we found a big void in the ground like the one before. I asked Tom "what should we do," and he said, "Jump in the black void."

        </p>
    </div>

       <div>
        <h3>DAY 17</h3>
        <p>
           I felt like I hit my head really hard when I came threw the void. I couldnt make out anything but I still tried to stand up. I heared stomping sounds coming from a hallway next to me. I felt super scared but it was just Tom running to me. He help me get up then I dusted myself off and then Tom ask me, "Do you think we might get out of this place." I didnt know what to say so I just nodded and walked along. We walked for what felt like hours and hours. By the time my leags were killing me, we had found a huge metal door with a lock on it. I felt like I could sleep for 24 hours staight. Tom said, "We need a silver key to unlock this." We found a dry spot on the ground and slept there for the night.


        </p>
    </div>

       <div>
        <h3>DAY 18</h3>
        <p>
            I woke up with my arm and back very sore. I asked Tom "were should we go to find this "key," Tom said, "Its problaly in one of those maze like hallways that are thin and short." We both stood up and started looking for what Tom said. A long time pasted later but we found nothing, me and Tom were very disappointed.


        </p>
    </div>

       <div>
        <h3>DAY 19</h3>
        <p>
            the pain in my back and arm has gotten worse. I told Tom that my back and arm felt like they had been pulled hard, Tom said "It might have been when we had jumped into the black void. I did think that too. Tom said "You should stay here, ill go and search for the key," I nodded. Tom slowly disapeared behind a corner. I waved goodbye and just sat there for hours. I didnt really know what to do, so I stood up and started walking around in circles. Hours later Tom finally came back but with no key.

        </p>
    </div>

       <div>
        <h3>DAY 20</h3>
        <p>
           me and Tom were boared of trying to find this "key", so we just started walking around this place. We saw more monsters come and go. My legs were getting very tired so we took a quick rest. After a few minutes of resting I hopped on my legs and helped Tom up. We walked and walked until we saw a light flicker around a corner. Me and Tom hid behind a small alley and peaped out to see what was going on. What we saw shocked us. Tom sceamed "My brother!" Tom ran as fast as his little legs could go and hugged his brother. I just stood there and thought, Tom had a brother wow I have a brother too. Toms brother said, "I found a silver key, I didnt know what it is used for so I picked it up and put it in my pocket!". Then he showed it to us. It was shinny and had the letter B on the side. I didnt know why the letter B I would have perferd the letter Z but whatever. Me, Tom and Toms brother were all restless so we lay down and slept.

       <div>
        <h3>DAY 21</h3>
        <p>
           we were all ganna get out of this place. I was super duper excited. We rushed to find the great big door with the keyhole in it. Tom got the key and put it in. A ray of light beamed and the ground shook. After a couple of seconds the door was open, but it wasn't what we were expecting. It was a long long long hallway with doors everywere. Tom opened a door and we could see a dark room with a tall black figrue with white glowing eyes. It started running after us so Tom slamed the door shut. I said "Maybe one of these doors is to the real world," Tom and his brother both nodded and walked along the hallway. We opened lots of doors but we couldn't see anything good. One door had a noodle guy in it, another door had dead people. After hours opening doors we all went to sleep.


        </p>

       <div>
        <h3>DAY 22</h3>
        <p>
           we woke up and found the big door and searched for the right world. My legs, arms, feet, head and body were stinging alot, but I kept on opening doors. Me and Tom opened a door together and saw a little town. We called Toms brother to come and take a look. He came running to us and said "What do you need me for." Me and Tom pointed to the town in the door. Toms brother shouted "Wow." We told him to quite down. Toms brother rushed into the door, then Tom and then me. I started walking over to a tall wide building. Tom Rushed to open the front door. It looked like a 1960's style building. It had a front desk and to the side of the room were 2 moldy old arm chairs. The roof was covered in what looked like ciggarette stains. Toms brother walked up to the front desk and looked around. I said "I'll just wait outside," but a beeping sound cut me off. It was coming from the stairs to the left. Me and Tom started walking up to the stairs. Creek. It felt like I was walking on sharp nails. Once me and Tom got to the top, Toms brother was being a scardy cat. He said "go without me!" so me and tom did. Me and Tom both saw a bed. It looked so good. I really tryed hard to not jump on it, but that failed. I heard a shout. It sounded like an old man shouting at someone. A few seconds later their was an old man shouting. He did calm down after awhile. The old man said "Are you stuck in the backrooms?" Splat. He spat in the bucket next to him. The old man continued "Well you are in a good place!" Splat. Into the bucket again. I was starting to get a weird feeling about this guy. "Why is this a good place?" Tom asked. "AAHH your kids, you wont understand, but here," The old man pulled out an old mattress. "Its good for 3 people!" He said. I called for Toms brother, he had just finished the stairs. Tom had to explain everything to his brother. We all got onto the mattress. It wasnt that nice, but I still had my pillow. Yes I have been carring it around this entire place. I put my pillow down and slept.
