        <h3>DAY 1</h3>
        <p>
            I seem to have clipped in this hallway when I went down an alley. I don't really know where I am right now, but
            all I can see is long hallways and stains on the wall. I'm scared.

        <h3>DAY 2</h3>
        <p>
            I slept on the floor of this place, it wasn't that nice. the floor was very wet and slimy. I started searching
            for what might have made the slime. A little while later I was able to find a small slime blob, it was orange
            and had a small cute face. Once it had seen me it jolted at me. I think it was trying to tickle me, so I jumped
            back and ran for my life. Thank goodness it was about as fast as a slug, so I could easily run away.

        <h3>DAY 3</h3>
        <p>
         I found a small bench with a wet pillow on it, so I slept there for the night. It wasn't the best but at least I 
            was off the floor. Once I woke up I heard rumbling noises coming from a room next to where I slept. I peeped
            inside it and I saw a huge black figrue. Its back was turned against me so it didn't see me. When I saw the
            monster I grabbed the pillow I had slept on and sprinted away. The monster looked like it was dripping
            with oil or black sludge. I tried to find a way out of this creepy place but it seemed like it kept on going
            forever

        <h3>DAY 4</h3>
        <p>
           I feel super hungry, but thankfully I have been finding almond water everywhere. At first it seemed a little weird, but now Im getting used to it. I have also been seeing these other monsters lurching around, I even saw another human being tangled by a red and white beast. The beast said something like, "Why you in backrooms human?" At that point I had never ever heard of backrooms, but I guess that's where I am right now.

        <h3>DAY 7</h3>
        <p>
            I have been forgetting to write in the journle. I've been seeing lots of monsters go by and collecting almond water, but today I found a black void in the middle of the floor. I have been seeing lots and lots of deep holes in the floor, but nothing like what I saw here. It was swirling round and round, and I saw one of the monsters come after me so I leapt into the black void.

        <h3>DAY 8</h3>
        <p>
           It seemed I teleported to another room. This one had office chairs and desks in it. Their were endless doors I could open one and there would be 3 more. When I opened a door, I made sure I had closed it so that nothing could follow me.

        <h3>DAY 9</h3>
        <p>
           This place is making me crazy. I thought I saw my brother here but I was just day dreaming. I seem to have run into a iron door with a big metal lock on it. I dont know were that had come from but I wanted to know more, then I saw the orange monster again but this time it was faster than beafore. I ran as fast as I could to get away from it but it was way to fast, so when it was chasing me I hid behind a corner and hoped it wouldnt see me.
