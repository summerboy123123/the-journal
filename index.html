        <h3>DAY 1</h3>
        <p>
            I seem to have clipped in this hallway when I went down an alley. I don't really know where I am right now, but
            all I can see is long hallways and stains on the wall. I'm scared.

        <h3>DAY 2</h3>
        <p>
            I slept on the floor of this place, it wasn't that nice. the floor was very wet and slimy. I started searching
            for what might have made the slime. A little while later I was able to find a small slime blob, it was orange
            and had a small cute face. Once it had seen me it jolted at me. I think it was trying to tickle me, so I jumped
            back and ran for my life. Thank goodness it was about as fast as a slug, so I could easily run away.

        <h3>DAY 3</h3>
        <p>
         I found a small bench with a wet pillow on it, so I slept there for the night. It wasn't the best but at least I 
            was off the floor. Once I woke up I heard rumbling noises coming from a room next to where I slept. I peeped
            inside it and I saw a huge black figrue. Its back was turned against me so it didn't see me. When I saw the
            monster I grabbed the pillow I had slept on and sprinted away. The monster looked like it was dripping
            with oil or black sludge. I tried to find a way out of this creepy place but it seemed like it kept on going
            forever
